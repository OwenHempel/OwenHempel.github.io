\paragraph{
I am interested in applying for your Engineering Outage Manager (EOM) position. In particular, I am most interested in the B1881 outage, as I am a Responsible System Engineer in Fuel Handling Engineering at Bruce B. I have discussed this with my Section Manager, and have his approval to take this role.}
\paragraph{
I have been employed at Bruce Power since June 2016 in the Bruce B Fuel Handling Section. I am the Responsible System Engineer for Fuel Handling Computer systems, as well as Fuel Handling Inverters. As well, I have completed a 16 month internship employed at Bruce Power under the Outage and Maintenance group Specialized Tool Engineering and Reactor Tooling/Fuel Handling Design section. Between these work experiences I feel that I bring valuable experience to the outage.}
