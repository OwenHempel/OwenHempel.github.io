full time employees and a large number of contractors.
<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   This was my first experience in the professional engineering world. I have gained an enormous amount of
experience with professional work and general engineering. On top of that, I have received thorough training
in a wide range of subjects. In particular, my work was related to systems design and integration of individual
vendor products.

opportunity to take. Some of these include radiation safety courses, extensive WHMIS courses, and more. My
short time with Tool Engineering has been spent on a mixture of projects, which mainly revolve around
maintaining or upgrading existing systems.
