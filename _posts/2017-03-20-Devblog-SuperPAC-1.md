[SuperPAC](https://github.com/Phantom410/SuperPAC) is my little pet project. It's a work in progress, but it's coming along very nicely. Why am I doing this? I'd like to solve the [XKCD nerd sniping problem](https://xkcd.com/356/). 

I'm actually hoping it can be useful, too. The aim for the project is a pure-python package, which can be used as an imported package, a command-line tool, or a full GUI. For the GUI, I'd really like to build the whole thing into a web framework. A browser-run simulator that's good enough for first-year physics would be really cool, I think. you can always model other systems as well.

Anyways, the hardest part is turning out to be solutions generation. The reduction is very expensive in terms of looping, so I need to improve the algorithm for that.
